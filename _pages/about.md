I am an economics PhD candidate at [Boston University](https://www.bu.edu/econ/). My research is centered around applied and theoretical econometrics with applications to labor and health economics. I am interested in developing econometric and statistical tools to better understand distributional outcomes and to flexibly estimate heterogeneous treatment effects of regulatory and welfare policies on outcomes of interest.
